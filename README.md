# MAC-change

This is a simple script which generates a random MAC address and assigns it to your network card.

## Instructions for Mac OS X installation:
#### Note: This is a quick script made for Mac OS X 10.13.6. I haven't yet checked compatibility for any other version or OS. However, it should work for most UNIX systems.

1. Open a Terminal window (Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal)
2. Copy and paste the following, pressing `ENTER` after each line:
3. `git clone https://github.com/theodorehadges/mac-change.git`
4. `cd MAC-change`
5. `chmod +x change-my-MAC`
6. `./change-my-MAC`
7. Turn your WiFi off then back on

## TODO:
* check linux compatibility
* add to crontab
* create option for emulating MAC address for specific device/manufacturer
